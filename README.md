# humanoid_manipulator
Intelligent Robot Competition – Humanoid Robot Sports

## Outline
> ROS2 package for autonomous control of a humanoid manipulator.  
> Supports Pinocchio-based IK computation, motion generation, and Teleop/Auto modes.
> Generates end-effector trajectories according to task objectives and computes IK to produce arm motions.
> Performs collision checking using Pinocchio + URDF-based geometry (HPP-FCL) to ensure arm-motion safety before execution.
> Blends generated arm motions with lower-body motions (from Motion Teacher), enabling synchronized and stable full-body motion

## Overview
The **humanoid_manipulator** package provides inverse kinematics, motion control, and collision-aware manipulation for a humanoid robot.  
It integrates:
- In the ROS2 environment, end-effector trajectories are generated according to the assigned task. Inverse kinematics (IK) is then computed to generate corresponding arm motions.
- The Pinocchio library is used within ROS2 to perform collision checking based on the geometric models defined in the URDF. This ensures the safety of arm motions before execution.
- The generated arm motions are blended with lower-body motions created using the Motion Teacher, allowing the whole robot to move in a stable manner. Through this process, the arm and lower body are controlled synchronously.
